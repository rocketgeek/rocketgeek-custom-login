# RocketGeek Custom Login (Dark)
RocketGeek Custom Login (Dark) is a simple WordPress example plugin that creates a custom login screen.

## Assumptions
- This is a custom plugin and is not intended for general distribution.
- There is no customization ability in the WP admin. Any customization is done by editing the css and/or main plugin class.  (It's a "one-and-done" kind-of-thing.)

## Qualifications
Normally, a plugin created for general distribution would utilize OOP best practices, etc. However, for the purposes of this exercise, the plugin combines multiple elements and functions into as few files as possible within the plugin directory.

## Installation
- Install and activate like any other plugin.
